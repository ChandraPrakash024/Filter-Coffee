### Interfaces:
1. **`Firewall_IFC`**:
   - Defines the methods to interact with the firewall module:
     - `pass_inps`: Passes input values (IP protocol, source port, and destination port) to the firewall.
     - `getResult`: Returns the result of whether the packet is safe or not (based on hash lookup).
     - `readyRecv`: Indicates if the firewall is ready to accept inputs.
     - `readyRes`: Indicates if the firewall has a result ready.

2. **`Hash_IFC`**:
   - Provides methods for the hash computation:
     - `putInputs`: Receives three inputs to compute the hash.
     - `getHash`: Returns the computed hash value.
     - `validHash`: Signals if the hash is valid and ready.

### `mkFirewall` Module:
This is the main firewall module that instantiates other components like BRAM and the hash computation engine.

1. **BRAM Setup**:
   - A BRAM module (`dut0`) is instantiated using `mkBRAM2Server` to store and retrieve hash values.
   - The BRAM is configured to disable write response bypass and loads data from a memory file `bloomfilter.mem` (likely storing the Bloom filter to check hashes).

2. **State Machine (`BSVWrapperState`)**:
   - The firewall operates in three states:
     - **`READY`**: Ready to accept inputs.
     - **`WAIT`**: Waiting for the hash to be computed.
     - **`GET_RESULT`**: The hash has been computed and the result from BRAM is ready to be retrieved.

3. **Registers**:
   - Several registers are used to hold intermediate values like IP protocol, source port, destination port, hash value, and the result.

4. **Hashing Process**:
   - In the rule `run_timer`, when the firewall is in the `WAIT` state, it checks if the hash computation is complete by calling `hashComputer.validHash()`.
   - If the hash is valid, it uses the hash value to access BRAM and checks if the packet is allowed.

5. **Input and Result Handling**:
   - The method `pass_inps` accepts inputs (IP protocol, source port, destination port), which are sent to the hash computer for processing.
   - The method `getResult` retrieves the result from BRAM and compares it to determine if the packet is safe.

### `mkHash` Module:
This module implements the hash computation logic.

1. **State Machine (`HashComputeState`)**:
   - The hash computation involves multiple steps (C1 to C6), where each step modifies intermediate registers `a1`, `b1`, `c1`, etc.
   - The final hash is stored in `hashKey`.

2. **Hash Calculation**:
   - The hash is calculated based on a set of transformations on the input values (`k0`, `k1`, `k2`). These inputs are processed through a series of shifts and XOR operations to generate the final hash.

### Testbench (`mkTb` Module):
This is the testbench to simulate the firewall module.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Two sets of test inputs (`ip_pro_1`, `port1_1`, `port2_1` and `ip_pro_2`, `port1_2`, `port2_2`) are defined, representing IP addresses, source ports, and destination ports.
   - The rule `init` sends the first set of inputs to the firewall and triggers the process.

2. **Result Checking**:
   - The rule `r1` waits until the firewall signals that the result is ready (`readyRes`), retrieves the result using `getResult`, and displays it.

3. **Simulation Finish**:
   - The testbench ends the simulation after the first result is processed (`$finish`).

### Overall Functionality:
- The firewall computes a hash based on the IP protocol, source port, and destination port of incoming packets.
- This hash is used to check the packet against values stored in BRAM (possibly a Bloom filter), determining if the packet should be allowed or blocked.
- The testbench provides test cases to validate this functionality.
