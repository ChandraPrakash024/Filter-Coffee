# Ethernet System Verilog Modules

This repository contains a collection of Verilog modules designed for building high-performance Ethernet systems. The modules support Ethernet speeds from 1G to 10G and cover a wide range of Ethernet-related functionalities, including MAC (Media Access Control), PHY (Physical Layer), IP, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), error detection (Frame Check Sequence - FCS), and more. These modules are designed to be modular, so you can mix and match them to suit your application needs. They are primarily intended for FPGA or hardware development.

## Overview

This repository provides a suite of Verilog components for building Ethernet-based communication systems. Whether you're working on 1G or 10G Ethernet designs, these modules enable you to easily integrate Ethernet functionalities into your FPGA or hardware design projects. The repository includes essential components for Ethernet communication, including MAC (Media Access Control), PHY (Physical Layer) interfaces, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses, IP (Internet Protocol) for routing packets, and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for fast data transmission.

Modules are designed to be used independently or together, depending on the needs of your application. The included testbenches allow you to validate your design through simulation before deploying it.

## Key Components

### Ethernet MAC Modules
Ethernet MAC modules handle framing, addressing, and communication of Ethernet frames. These modules interface with the higher-layer protocols (like IP, UDP) and the physical layer (PHY).

- **`eth_mac_1g`**: 1G Ethernet MAC with GMII interface. Handles Ethernet frames for 1G Ethernet systems.
- **`eth_mac_10g`**: 10G Ethernet MAC with XGMII interface. Designed for 10G Ethernet systems, supports 32-bit or 64-bit datapaths.
- **`eth_mac_phy_10g`**: Combines both the MAC and PHY logic for 10G Ethernet, interfacing with the physical layer transceivers.
- **`eth_mac_*_fifo`**: Versions of MAC modules with FIFO buffers, improving data throughput and handling bursty traffic.

These modules provide core functionality for frame transmission and reception, frame formatting, and error detection.

---

### Ethernet PHY Modules
The PHY modules interface with the physical layer (cabling, connectors, etc.) and handle tasks like signal encoding and decoding.

- **`eth_phy_10g`**: 10G Ethernet PCS/PMA PHY module for handling physical layer encoding/decoding.
- **`eth_phy_10g_rx`**: PHY receive-side logic for 10G Ethernet.
- **`eth_phy_10g_tx`**: PHY transmit-side logic for 10G Ethernet.
- **`eth_mac_phy_10g`**: Integrated MAC and PHY module for 10G Ethernet systems.

These PHY modules enable communication between the digital logic and the physical layer hardware (e.g., cables, connectors).

---

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
ARP is used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses, enabling communication between devices on an Ethernet network.

- **`arp`**: Handles ARP requests and replies.
- **`arp_cache`**: A simple cache to store IP-to-MAC address mappings.
- **`arp_eth_rx` / `arp_eth_tx`**: Handle reception and transmission of ARP frames.
- **`arp_64`**: A 64-bit version of the ARP modules for 10G Ethernet.

These modules ensure that devices can dynamically resolve MAC addresses from IP addresses for proper communication.

---

### IP (Internet Protocol)
IP handles addressing and routing of data packets between devices on the network.

- **`ip` / `ip_64`**: Modules for IPv4 processing, supporting both 1G and 10G Ethernet systems.
- **`ip_complete` / `ip_complete_64`**: A complete IPv4 stack integrating IP and ARP for full end-to-end communication.
- **`ip_eth_rx` / `ip_eth_tx`**: Modules to receive and transmit IP packets.

These modules provide IP addressing, packet forwarding, and integration with ARP for IP-to-MAC resolution.

---

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol used for fast, real-time data transmission.

- **`udp` / `udp_64`**: Handle UDP packet processing for both 1G and 10G Ethernet systems.
- **`udp_complete` / `udp_complete_64`**: Complete UDP stack integrating IP and ARP.
- **`udp_checksum_gen`**: Generates UDP checksums for error detection in packets.

UDP modules are perfect for applications requiring low-latency communication like real-time data streaming or VoIP.

---

### FCS (Frame Check Sequence)
FCS is used to detect errors in Ethernet frames.

- **`axis_eth_fcs`**: Computes the FCS checksum for Ethernet frames.
- **`axis_eth_fcs_insert`**: Inserts the FCS checksum into transmitted frames.
- **`axis_eth_fcs_check`**: Verifies the FCS of received frames.

These modules ensure that frames are transmitted error-free and help detect transmission errors.

---

### Multiplexers and Demultiplexers
These components are used to manage multiple Ethernet streams within the same system.

- **`eth_arb_mux`**: Muxes multiple input streams into a single output stream with configurable arbitration schemes.
- **`eth_demux`**: Demuxes a single input stream into multiple output streams.

These modules are useful in complex networking hardware where multiple Ethernet channels need to be managed concurrently.

---

## AXI Stream Interface
The modules in this repository communicate via **AXI Stream**, a widely-used protocol for high-speed data transmission in FPGA systems. The AXI Stream interface provides the following key signals:

- **`tdata`**: The data being transmitted.
- **`tvalid`**: Indicates that valid data is available.
- **`tready`**: The sink is ready to receive data.
- **`tkeep`**: Indicates which parts of the data are valid (for wide datapaths).
- **`tlast`**: Marks the end of a frame or packet.
- **`tuser`**: Carries additional user-specific data, often for error detection.

These signals are fundamental in transmitting Ethernet frames or packets in a streamlined manner, ensuring compatibility with various networking protocols.

---

## Testbenches and Cosimulation
Testbenches are provided to simulate and validate the functionality of the modules before integrating them into a final design.

- **Testbenches**: Written in MyHDL, these testbenches allow for comprehensive testing of modules like ARP, UDP, GMII, and XGMII.
- **Cosimulation**: The testbenches can be used with Icarus Verilog for cosimulation, helping you verify your Verilog code in a simulation environment.
- **Examples**: Specific testbenches for individual components like ARP, UDP, and Ethernet MAC/PHY interfaces ensure that you can test specific functionality in isolation.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use the provided modules:

1. Instantiate an Ethernet MAC module, such as `eth_mac_1g`, to handle the data frames.
2. Use an `eth_phy_10g` module for interfacing with the physical layer.
3. Implement the `ip_complete` module to add IP addressing and routing.
4. Use the `udp_complete` module for transmitting and receiving UDP packets.
5. Verify your design with the provided testbenches and cosimulation setup.

Please refer to the example testbenches in the `tests/` directory for detailed implementation examples.
