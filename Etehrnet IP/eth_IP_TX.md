### 1. **Ethernet Frame Transmission**
   The basic task of the module is to send Ethernet frames to the network. An Ethernet frame consists of a preamble, the data payload, and possibly a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), though CRC generation is not explicitly handled in this module. The module reads the frame data from a buffer (BRAM) and transmits it byte-by-byte to the physical layer (PHY).

### 2. **Preamble Initialization**
   - **Purpose:** Every Ethernet frame starts with a preamble of 7 bytes (`0x55` repeated 6 times) followed by a Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) byte (`0xD5`). The preamble helps the receiver synchronize with the transmitter.
   - **Logic:** 
     - The module initializes the preamble in BRAM, and this initialization happens before any data is sent.
     - The rule `r_initialize_bram` writes the preamble bytes to the buffer (BRAM) one byte at a time, and then sets `initialize_bram` to `False` after completion.

### 3. **Memory Buffer Management (BRAM)**
   - **Purpose:** The BRAM (Block RAM) is used as a temporary buffer to hold frame data before transmission.
   - **Logic:** 
     - The MAC interface writes the frame data into this buffer.
     - The buffer supports dual-port read/write access (`frame.a` for reading and `frame.b` for writing), allowing simultaneous operations.
     - Data is stored in BRAM at byte-level granularity.

### 4. **Byte and Nibble Transmission**
   - **Purpose:** Ethernet PHYs often work at lower data granularities, such as nibbles (4-bit units), especially in lower-speed interfaces like MII (Media Independent Interface). So, the module must transmit each byte as two nibbles.
   - **Logic:**
     - The frame data is written to BRAM by the MAC as bytes (8-bit). But when the data is read from BRAM to send to the PHY, it is split into two parts:
       - The **lower 4 bits** (LSB nibble) is sent first.
       - The **upper 4 bits** (MSB nibble) is sent afterward.
     - The state `is_msb_nibble` tracks whether the next nibble to be sent is the upper or lower one. Two separate rules (`r_phy_send_lsb_nibble` and `r_phy_send_msb_nibble`) manage the nibble transmission process.

### 5. **Flow Control**
   - **Purpose:** The module needs to manage when to accept new data from the MAC and when to transmit to the PHY, ensuring smooth flow without overwriting data.
   - **Logic:**
     - **`m_ready_to_recv_next_frame`:** The MAC can write new frame data only if the current frame is fully transmitted (`buffer_in_use` is `False`).
     - **`m_write_tx_frame`:** When the MAC writes data, the module stores the bytes in BRAM. If `is_last_byte` is set, it marks the frame as fully written (`is_frame_fully_written`).
     - Data is continuously read from BRAM and sent to PHY as long as there is unsent data (`bytes_written > bytes_sent_to_phy_addr` and `buffer_in_use` is `True`).

### 6. **Inter-frame Gap (IFG)**
   - **Purpose:** Ethernet standards require a minimum "inter-frame gap" between two consecutive frames to allow devices to process the previous frame and prepare for the next one. This gap is usually around 96-bit times (12 bytes) for 10/100 Mbps Ethernet.
   - **Logic:**
     - After fully transmitting a frame, the module enters the "inter-frame gap" period (`interframe_counter < 0x1A`).
     - During this period, it sends idle signals (invalid nibbles) to the PHY.
     - The `r_interframe_gap` rule ensures that this gap is maintained by sending idle data before resetting the module for the next frame.

### 7. **Reset and Re-initialization**
   - **Purpose:** Once a frame is fully transmitted, the module resets its internal state to prepare for the next frame.
   - **Logic:**
     - After the inter-frame gap is complete and the frame has been fully transmitted (indicated by `is_frame_fully_written`), the module resets the `buffer_in_use`, `bytes_written`, `bytes_sent_to_phy_addr`, and other state variables.
     - This reset is handled by the `r_reset_setup` rule, which ensures the module is ready for the next frame.

### 8. **Synchronization with the PHY Layer**
   - **Purpose:** The module sends data to the physical Ethernet interface using the `phy_tx.send_data()` function.
   - **Logic:** 
     - Data is sent nibble-by-nibble to the PHY through the `phy_tx.send_data()` method.
     - The physical layer's interface (`PhyTXIfc`) handles the actual transmission over the physical network medium.

### Conclusion:
The overall logic is a state machine that cycles through the following phases:
1. **Initialize the preamble** in the BRAM.
2. **Accept frame data** from the MAC and store it in the BRAM.
3. **Transmit the frame data** from BRAM to the PHY, splitting bytes into nibbles as needed.
4. **Ensure an inter-frame gap** before accepting new data.
5. **Reset the internal state** and prepare for the next frame.

The module effectively implements a flow-control mechanism, ensuring the correct timing and transmission of Ethernet frames, byte-by-byte and nibble-by-nibble, while complying with Ethernet protocol standards like the preamble, SFD, and IFG requirements.
